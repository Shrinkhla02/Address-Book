## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- NPM (v6.x or higher)
- MySQL

## Installation and Setup

### Database Setup

1. The MySQL database is hosted on Azure. You will need to configure your database connection:

   ```
   DB_HOST=your_azure_mysql_host
   DB_USER=your_database_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   DB_PORT=3306
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the above configuration.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   For production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

4. The API server will be running at `http://localhost:8000` (or your configured port).

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the API endpoint in `.env`:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. For production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Enhancement Opportunities

The current system has several areas where improvements can be made:

1. **Data Expansion**: While the current dataset contains approximately 1,200 records, the database and indexing structure support significant scaling.

2. **Search Optimization**: The search functionality is currently indexed for performance, but additional filtering options could enhance user experience.

3. **Authentication System**: Implementing a more robust user authentication and authorization system.

4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Adding visualization tools to provide insights from the data.

5. **API Documentation**: Expanding the API documentation with Swagger or similar tools.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
**Database Connection Errors**:
   - Verify database credentials in your `.env` file
   - Ensure Azure firewall settings allow your IP address
