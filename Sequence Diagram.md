# Address Search Sequence Diagram Analysis

![Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04c4dc9d-2039-41a1-95a4-61ac4b4297bd)

## Overview

This document provides an analysis of the sequence diagram for a Spring Boot application that implements an address search functionality. The diagram illustrates the interaction between various components in a typical layered architecture pattern.

## Components

The sequence diagram includes the following components:

- **Client**: The consumer of the API
- **AddressController**: REST controller handling HTTP requests
- **AddressService**: Service layer for business logic
- **AddressSpecification**: Specifications for dynamic querying
- **AddressRepository**: Data access layer
- **AddressServiceFactory**: Factory for creating appropriate service instances
- **CountrySpecificFactory**: Factory for country-specific address handling

## Flow Description

### 1. Request Initiation
- The Client sends a GET request to `/addresses/search` with search parameters
- Parameters may include: name, addressLine, countryCodes, region, city, code, pageable information

### 2. Controller Processing
- The AddressController receives the request and delegates to the service layer
- It calls `searchAddresses()` with all the provided parameters

### 3. Service Layer Processing
- The AddressService first creates a search specification:
  - Calls `searchAddresses(parameters)` on the AddressSpecification
  - Receives a Specification object for filtering

- The AddressService then queries the repository:
  - Calls `findAll(specification, pageable)` on the AddressRepository
  - Receives a Page of Address entities

### 4. Country-Specific Processing
- For each Address in the results page, the AddressService:
  - Calls `getHandler(address.countryCode)` on the AddressServiceFactory
  - Receives a CountrySpecificFactory appropriate for the address's country
  - Maps the Address to a country-specific DTO via `mapToCountrySpecificDTO(address)`
  - Receives a CountrySpecificAddressDTO with formatted country-specific details

### 5. Response Preparation
- The AddressService compiles a Page of CountrySpecificAddressDTO objects
- Returns this page to the controller

### 6. Response Delivery
- The AddressController returns an HTTP 200 OK response
- The response body contains an ApiResponse object with the page of addresses

## Design Patterns Used

1. **MVC Pattern**: Separation of concerns between controller, service, and repository
2. **Specification Pattern**: For dynamic query building based on search criteria
3. **Factory Pattern**: To handle country-specific address formatting requirements
4. **DTO Pattern**: For transforming internal domain objects to API response objects
5. **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction

## Benefits of This Architecture

- **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Flexibility**: Search parameters can be easily extended
- **Internationalization**: Country-specific address formatting is handled appropriately
- **Scalability**: Pagination support for handling large result sets

## Performance Considerations

- The design includes pagination support to handle large result sets efficiently
- Country-specific transformations are performed in a loop, which could be a performance concern for large result sets
- We can Consider batch processing or parallel streams for large datasets
